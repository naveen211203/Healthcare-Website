## Problem statement 
Even with the wealth of information on the internet, there is still a large deficiency in easily accessed and customized resources for people looking for advice on diet and illness prevention. Many individuals find it difficult to make well-informed choices regarding their diet and way of life, which can result in unhealthy eating patterns, a higher chance of avoidable illnesses, and a lack of proactive health management. The difficulty of effectively addressing these issues is further compounded by the complexity of medical advice and the scarcity of personalized guidance. A comprehensive healthcare website is desperately needed, one that provides age-appropriate disease prevention strategies and nutritional information, enabling people to take charge of their health and make educated decisions.

## About the project

By offering disease cure precautions and preventive strategies, our website empowers users to take proactive steps toward reducing their risk of developing these conditions.
